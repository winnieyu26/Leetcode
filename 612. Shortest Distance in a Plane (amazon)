The distance between two points p1(x1, y1) and p2(x2, y2) is sqrt((x2 - x1)2 + (y2 - y1)2).
 
Write an SQL query to report the shortest distance between any two points from the Point2D table. Round the distance to two decimal points.
 
The query result format is in the following example.
 
 
 
Example 1:
 
Input: 
Point2D table:
+----+----+
| x  | y  |
+----+----+
| -1 | -1 |
| 0  | 0  |
| -1 | -2 |
+----+----+
Output: 
+----------+
| shortest |
+----------+
| 1.00     |
+----------+
Explanation: The shortest distance is 1.00 from point (-1, -1) to (-1, 2).
 
 
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT ROUND(MIN(SQRT(POWER(p1.x - p2.x, 2)+POWER(p1.y - p2.y, 2))),2) shortest
FROM point_2d p1, point_2d p2
WHERE CONCAT(p1.x,p1.y) <> CONCAT(p2.x,p2.y)
 
# power(a , b) -->  a^b
 
select round(sqrt((a.x-b.x)*(a.x-b.x)+(a.y-b.y)*(a.y-b.y)),2) shortest 
from point_2d a inner join point_2d  b on  (a.x!=b.x or a.y!=b.y)
order by shortest  limit 1
