Write an SQL query to report all the orders based on the following criteria:

If a customer has at least one order of type 0, do not report any order of type 1 from that customer.
Otherwise, report all the orders of the customer.
Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Orders table:
+----------+-------------+------------+
| order_id | customer_id | order_type |
+----------+-------------+------------+
| 1        | 1           | 0          |
| 2        | 1           | 0          |
| 11       | 2           | 0          |
| 12       | 2           | 1          |
| 21       | 3           | 1          |
| 22       | 3           | 0          |
| 31       | 4           | 1          |
| 32       | 4           | 1          |
+----------+-------------+------------+
Output: 
+----------+-------------+------------+
| order_id | customer_id | order_type |
+----------+-------------+------------+
| 31       | 4           | 1          |
| 32       | 4           | 1          |
| 1        | 1           | 0          |
| 2        | 1           | 0          |
| 11       | 2           | 0          |
| 22       | 3           | 0          |
+----------+-------------+------------+
Explanation: 
Customer 1 has two orders of type 0. We return both of them.
Customer 2 has one order of type 0 and one order of type 1. We only return the order of type 0.
Customer 3 has one order of type 0 and one order of type 1. We only return the order of type 0.
Customer 4 has two orders of type 1. We return both of them.

SELECT * FROM Orders
WHERE customer_id IN 
(Select customer_id FROM Orders
WHERE order_type = 0)  # 只取了customer_id有order_type = 0 像是 1,2,3
AND order_type = 0   # 其中 只拿order_type = 0
UNION ALL
SELECT * FROM Orders
WHERE customer_id NOT IN
(Select customer_id FROM Orders
WHERE order_type = 0)  # 只取了customer_id 的order_type = 1
