# Write your MySQL query statement below

# 法 １
select AVG(question_id) as survey_log
from survey_log
GROUP BY question_id   --> 又忘記 group by 
ORDER BY SUM(if(action = "answer", 1, 0)) / SUM(if(action = "show", 1, 0)) DESC   --> 找MAX: ORDER BY LIMIT 1 
        -- OR: SUM(if(action = "answer", 1, 0)) / count(*)
LIMIT 1



# 法 ２
select question_id as survey_log
from (
  select
      question_id,
      sum(if(action = 'answer', 1, 0)) as AnswerCnt,
      sum(if(action = 'show', 1, 0)) as ShowCnt
  from
      survey_log
  group by question_id
) as t
order by (AnswerCnt / ShowCnt) desc
limit 1
