Table point holds the x coordinate of some points on x-axis in a plane, which are all integers.
 

Write a query to find the shortest distance between two points in these points.

| x   |
|-----|
| -1  |
| 0   |
| 2   |
 
The shortest distance is '1' obviously, which is from point '-1' to '0'. So the output is as below:
 
| shortest|
|---------|
| 1       |

Note: Every point is unique, which means there is no duplicates in table point.

Follow-up: What if all these points have an id and are arranged from the left most to the right most of x axis?

# Write your MySQL query statement below

-- 距離 用 abs()
-- 最短距離 用min(abs(ａ點 - b點))  必須 inner join 才有兩個table 合併出來兩點
-- self join (cross join 或是inner join）取出兩點 從不同的 "table" a, b 
-- join  __ ＯＮ 兩點不是同一點的時候： 用 != 或是 <>
-- 一定要加上 "point" a 點 或是 "point" b 才知道是 point table 


#select min(abs(a.x - b.x)) as shortest
#join b.x on a.x <> b.x  先看點在哪
#from point  # join 到哪
#from point a inner join point b 
#on a.x != b.x

select min(abs(a.x - b.x )) as shortest
from point a inner join point b on a.x != b.x
