Table: Product

+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| product_id   | int     |
| product_name | varchar |
| unit_price   | int     |
+--------------+---------+
product_id is the primary key of this table.
Table: Sales

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| seller_id   | int     |
| product_id  | int     |
| buyer_id    | int     |
| sale_date   | date    |
| quantity    | int     |
| price       | int     |
+------ ------+---------+
This table has no primary key, it can have repeated rows.
product_id is a foreign key to Product table.
 

Write an SQL query that reports the buyers who have bought S8 but not iPhone. Note that S8 and iPhone are products present in the Product table.

The query result format is in the following example:

Product table:
+------------+--------------+------------+
| product_id | product_name | unit_price |
+------------+--------------+------------+
| 1          | S8           | 1000       |
| 2          | G4           | 800        |
| 3          | iPhone       | 1400       |
+------------+--------------+------------+

Sales table:
+-----------+------------+----------+------------+----------+-------+
| seller_id | product_id | buyer_id | sale_date  | quantity | price |
+-----------+------------+----------+------------+----------+-------+
| 1         | 1          | 1        | 2019-01-21 | 2        | 2000  |
| 1         | 2          | 2        | 2019-02-17 | 1        | 800   |
| 2         | 1          | 3        | 2019-06-02 | 1        | 800   |
| 3         | 3          | 3        | 2019-05-13 | 2        | 2800  |
+-----------+------------+----------+------------+----------+-------+

Result table:
+-------------+
| buyer_id    |
+-------------+
| 1           |
+-------------+
The buyer with id 1 bought an S8 but didn't buy an iPhone. The buyer with id 3 bought both.

# Write your MySQL query statement below

# Write your MySQL query statement below

-- 1. buyers who have bought S8 but not iPhone: product_name= "S8" AND product_name != "iPhone"  
-- sales 的 buyer_id 

# Write your MySQL query statement below

-- best seller by total sales price, If there is a tie, report them all.
# 法 １
# having sum(p. = 'S8') >=1  AND sum(p. = 'iPhone') = 0
                    --> 有S8                 --> 沒iphone
select s.buyer_id
from product p 
inner join sales s on p.product_id = s.product_id
group by s.buyer_id
having sum(p.product_name = 'S8') >= 1 AND sum(p.product_name = 'iPhone') = 0

#或是 用 count if 或 sum >=1 代表買了, =0 代表沒買
SELECT S.buyer_id
FROM Sales S JOIN Product P
ON S.product_id = P.product_id
GROUP BY S.buyer_id
having sum(p.product_name='S8') >= 1 and sum(p.product_name='iphone') =0
或是
having COUNT(IF(P.product_name = 'S8',TRUE, NULL)) >= 1 AND COUNT(IF(P.product_name = 'iPhone',TRUE, NULL)) = 0


# 錯 me 
select distinct s.buyer_id
from Sales as s, Product as p 
-- where s.product_id=p.product_id and p.product_name = 'S8'  ## 錯！！！
group by p.product_name


# 法 ２ GROUP_CONCAT
# returns a string with concatenated non-NULL value from a group.
# Returns NULL when there are no non-NULL values.
SELECT buyer_id
FROM Sales S LEFT JOIN Product P ON S.Product_id = P.Product_id
GROUP BY buyer_id
HAVING GROUP_CONCAT(product_name) LIKE '%S8%' and GROUP_CONCAT(product_name) NOT LIKE '%iPhone%'


# 法 3
select distinct buyer_id   --> 選unique的 id 用 "distinct"
from Sales s join Product p on s.product_id=p.product_id
where p.product_name='S8' 
and buyer_id not in   --> why 不能直接 p.product_name ！='iPhone'?? 要用 NOT IN
   (select buyer_id
   from Sales s join Product p on s.product_id=p.product_id
   where p.product_name='iPhone')


# 用 where in , where not in 
SELECT DISTINCT BUYER_ID
FROM SALES
WHERE BUYER_ID IN (SELECT BUYER_ID
                   FROM SALES
                   WHERE PRODUCT_ID = (SELECT PRODUCT_ID
                                       FROM PRODUCT
                                       WHERE PRODUCT_NAME = 'S8'))
AND BUYER_ID NOT IN (SELECT BUYER_ID
                     FROM SALES
                     WHERE PRODUCT_ID = (SELECT PRODUCT_ID
