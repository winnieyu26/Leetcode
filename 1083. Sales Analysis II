Write an SQL query that reports the buyers who have bought S8 but not iPhone. Note that S8 and iPhone are products present in the Product table.

The query result format is in the following example:

Product table:
+------------+--------------+------------+
| product_id | product_name | unit_price |
+------------+--------------+------------+
| 1          | S8           | 1000       |
| 2          | G4           | 800        |
| 3          | iPhone       | 1400       |
+------------+--------------+------------+

Sales table:
+-----------+------------+----------+------------+----------+-------+
| seller_id | product_id | buyer_id | sale_date  | quantity | price |
+-----------+------------+----------+------------+----------+-------+
| 1         | 1          | 1        | 2019-01-21 | 2        | 2000  |
| 1         | 2          | 2        | 2019-02-17 | 1        | 800   |
| 2         | 1          | 3        | 2019-06-02 | 1        | 800   |
| 3         | 3          | 3        | 2019-05-13 | 2        | 2800  |
+-----------+------------+----------+------------+----------+-------+

Result table:
+-------------+
| buyer_id    |
+-------------+
| 1           |
+-------------+
The buyer with id 1 bought an S8 but didn't buy an iPhone. The buyer with id 3 bought both.

# Write your MySQL query statement below

-- 1. buyers who have bought S8 but not iPhone: product_name= "S8" AND product_name != "iPhone"  
-- sales 的 buyer_id 

select s.buyer_id as buyer_id
from product P
inner join sales s ON s.product_id = p.product_id
group by buyer_id
where product_name= "S8" AND 
product_name != "iPhone"   ### 錯了  


# 用 where in , where not in 
SELECT DISTINCT BUYER_ID
FROM SALES
WHERE BUYER_ID IN (SELECT BUYER_ID

                   WHERE PRODUCT_ID = (SELECT PRODUCT_ID
                                       FROM PRODUCT

# 用 count if 或 sum >=1 代表買了, =0 代表沒買
SELECT S.buyer_id
FROM Sales S JOIN Product P
ON S.product_id = P.product_id
GROUP BY S.buyer_id
having sum(p.product_name='S8') >= 1 and sum(p.product_name='iphone') =0
或是
HAVING COUNT(IF(P.product_name = 'S8',TRUE, NULL)) >= 1 AND COUNT(IF(P.product_name = 'iPhone',TRUE, NULL)) = 0
