# Write your MySQL query statement below
-- If the preferred delivery date of the customer is the same as the order date then the order is called immediate otherwise it's called scheduled: 

# Write an SQL query to find the percentage of immediate orders in the table, rounded to 2 decimal places.
-- the percentage: round( *100,2)
-- 将两数相除，round 保留 2 位小数 乘 100。


# 1.
select round(count(order_date = customer_pref_delivery_date)/count(*)*100, 2) as immediate_percentage
from Delivery


# 2.
select round (sum(case when order_date = customer_pref_delivery_date then 1 else 0 end) /
    count(*) * 100, 2)

# 3.
select round (
    sum(order_date = customer_pref_delivery_date) /
    count(*) * 100, 2) as immediate_percentage
