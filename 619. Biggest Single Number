Table my_numbers contains many numbers in column num including duplicated ones.
Can you write a SQL query to find the biggest number, which only appears once.

+---+
|num|
+---+
| 8 |
| 8 |
| 3 |
| 3 |
| 1 |
| 4 |
| 5 |
| 6 | 
For the sample data above, your query should return the following result:
+---+
|num|

# Write your MySQL query statement beloｗ

-- appears once: distinct, having count(*) = 1
-- 大到小 order by num desc
-- biggest : 用limit 1

-- 可以使用聚合函数进行空值null值的转换，具体的聚合函数包括SUM/AVG/MAX/MIN
-- 可以使用select语句进行转换，但空值应直接写在select中而非from中
-- limit语句无法出现新的null值
-- where和having同样无法出现新的null值
