Table: Activity

+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| player_id    | int     |
| device_id    | int     |
| event_date   | date    |
| games_played | int     |
+--------------+---------+
(player_id, event_date) is the primary key of this table.
This table shows the activity of players of some game.
Each row is a record of a player who logged in and played a number of games (possibly 0) before logging out on some day using some device.
 

Write an SQL query that reports for each player and date, how many games played so far by the player. That is, the total number of games played by the player until that date. Check the example for clarity.

The query result format is in the following example:

Activity table:
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
| player_id | device_id | event_date | games_played |
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
| 1         | 2         | 2016-03-01 | 5            |
| 1         | 2         | 2016-05-02 | 6            |
| 1         | 3         | 2017-06-25 | 1            |
| 3         | 1         | 2016-03-02 | 0            |
| 3         | 4         | 2018-07-03 | 5            |
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+

Result table:
+-----------+------------+---------------------+
| player_id | event_date | games_played_so_far |
+-----------+------------+---------------------+
| 1         | 2016-03-01 | 5                   |
| 1         | 2016-05-02 | 11                  |
| 1         | 2017-06-25 | 12                  |
| 3         | 2016-03-02 | 0                   |
| 3         | 2018-07-03 | 5                   |
+-----------+------------+---------------------+
For the player with id 1, 5 + 6 = 11 games played by 2016-05-02, and 5 + 6 + 1 = 12 games played by 2017-06-25.
For the player with id 3, 0 + 5 = 5 games played by 2018-07-03.
Note that for each player we only care about the days when the player logged in.

# Write your MySQL query statement below

# 第一步：自联结
select t1.player_id,t1.event_date
from Activity t1,Activity t2      
where t1.player_id=t2.player_id

# 第二步：找到时间在自身前面的数据,如图中灰色笔画出的部分。
t1.event_date>=t2.event_date

#第三步：用sum()group by对两个主键进行分组并求和，如图中棕色虚线圈出的部分。

 
# 結合 chengwu
select t1.player_id,
       t1.event_date,
       sum(t2.games_played) games_played_so_far
from Activity t1, Activity t2
where t1.player_id = t2.player_id
  and t1.event_date >= t2.event_date    --> id 相同
group by t1.player_id, t1.event_date    --> 3/1 之前的 或是 5/2之前的
