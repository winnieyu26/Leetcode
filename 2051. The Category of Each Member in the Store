A store wants to categorize its members. There are three tiers:

"Diamond": if the conversion rate is greater than or equal to 80.
"Gold": if the conversion rate is greater than or equal to 50 and less than 80.
"Silver": if the conversion rate is less than 50.
"Bronze": if the member never visited the store.
The conversion rate of a member is (100 * total number of purchases for the member) / total number of visits for the member.

Write an SQL query to report the id, the name, and the category of each member.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.


Example 1:

Input: 
Members table:
+-----------+---------+
| member_id | name    |
+-----------+---------+
| 9         | Alice   |
| 11        | Bob     |
| 3         | Winston |
| 8         | Hercy   |
| 1         | Narihan |
+-----------+---------+
Visits table:
+----------+-----------+------------+
| visit_id | member_id | visit_date |
+----------+-----------+------------+
| 22       | 11        | 2021-10-28 |
| 16       | 11        | 2021-01-12 |
| 18       | 9         | 2021-12-10 |
| 19       | 3         | 2021-10-19 |
| 12       | 11        | 2021-03-01 |
| 17       | 8         | 2021-05-07 |
| 21       | 9         | 2021-05-12 |
+----------+-----------+------------+
Purchases table:
+----------+----------------+
| visit_id | charged_amount |
+----------+----------------+
| 12       | 2000           |
| 18       | 9000           |
| 17       | 7000           |
+----------+----------------+
Output: 
+-----------+---------+----------+
| member_id | name    | category |
+-----------+---------+----------+
| 1         | Narihan | Bronze   |
| 3         | Winston | Silver   |
| 8         | Hercy   | Diamond  |
| 9         | Alice   | Gold     |
| 11        | Bob     | Silver   |
+-----------+---------+----------+
Explanation: 
- User Narihan with id = 1 did not make any visits to the store. She gets a Bronze category.
- User Winston with id = 3 visited the store one time and did not purchase anything. The conversion rate = (100 * 0) / 1 = 0. He gets a Silver category.
- User Hercy with id = 8 visited the store one time and purchased one time. The conversion rate = (100 * 1) / 1 = 1. He gets a Diamond category.
- User Alice with id = 9 visited the store two times and purchased one time. The conversion rate = (100 * 1) / 2 = 50. She gets a Gold category.
- User Bob with id = 11 visited the store three times and purchased one time. The conversion rate = (100 * 1) / 3 = 33.33. He gets a Silver category.

# Write your MySQL query statement below

WITH t AS (
SELECT m.member_id, m.name,
100 * COUNT(DISTINCT p.visit_id) / COUNT(DISTINCT v.visit_id) conversion
FROM Members m LEFT JOIN Visits v
ON m.member_id = v.member_id 
LEFT JOIN Purchases p 
ON v.visit_id = p.visit_id 
GROUP BY m.member_id
)

SELECT member_id, name,
CASE WHEN conversion >= 80 THEN 'Diamond'
WHEN conversion >= 50 THEN 'Gold' 
WHEN conversion < 50 THEN 'Silver'
ELSE 'Bronze' END category
FROM t
ORDER BY member_id;
