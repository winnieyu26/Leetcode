The Employee table holds all employees including their managers. Every employee has an Id, and there is also a column for the manager Id.

+------+----------+-----------+----------+
|Id    |Name 	  |Department |ManagerId |
+------+----------+-----------+----------+
|101   |John 	  |A 	      |null      |
|102   |Dan 	  |A 	      |101       |
|103   |James 	  |A 	      |101       |
|104   |Amy 	  |A 	      |101       |
|105   |Anne 	  |A 	      |101       |
|106   |Ron 	  |B 	      |101       |
+------+----------+-----------+----------+
Given the Employee table, write a SQL query that finds out managers with at least 5 direct report. For the above table, your SQL query should return:

+-------+
| Name  |
+-------+
| John  |
+-------+
Note:
No one would report to himself.

# Write your MySQL query statement below
-- managers at least 5 direct report

SELECT e1.Name AS 'Name'
FROM Employee AS e1
    INNER JOIN Employee AS e2  
        ON e1.Id = e2.ManagerId --> join on 表1的id = 表2的manager
GROUP BY e2.ManagerId     --> 忘記要 group by！ 第二個表的
HAVING COUNT(e1.Id) >= 5   --> 不用 is not null
