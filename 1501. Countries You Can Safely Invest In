# Leetcode

A telecommunications company wants to invest in new countries. The company intends to invest in the countries where the average call duration of the calls in this country is strictly greater than the global average call duration.

Write an SQL query to find the countries where this company can invest.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example:

 

Person table:
+----+----------+--------------+
| id | name     | phone_number |
+----+----------+--------------+
| 3  | Jonathan | 051-1234567  |
| 12 | Elvis    | 051-7654321  |
| 1  | Moncef   | 212-1234567  |
| 2  | Maroua   | 212-6523651  |
| 7  | Meir     | 972-1234567  |
| 9  | Rachel   | 972-0011100  |
+----+----------+--------------+

Country table:
+----------+--------------+
| name     | country_code |
+----------+--------------+
| Peru     | 051          |
| Israel   | 972          |
| Morocco  | 212          |
| Germany  | 049          |
| Ethiopia | 251          |
+----------+--------------+

Calls table:
+-----------+-----------+----------+
| caller_id | callee_id | duration |
+-----------+-----------+----------+
| 1         | 9         | 33       |
| 2         | 9         | 4        |
| 1         | 2         | 59       |
| 3         | 12        | 102      |
| 3         | 12        | 330      |
| 12        | 3         | 5        |
| 7         | 9         | 13       |
| 7         | 1         | 3        |
| 9         | 7         | 1        |
| 1         | 7         | 7        |
+-----------+-----------+----------+

Result table:
+----------+
| country  |
+----------+
| Peru     |
+----------+
The average call duration for Peru is (102 + 102 + 330 + 330 + 5 + 5) / 6 = 145.666667
The average call duration for Israel is (33 + 4 + 13 + 13 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 7) / 8 = 9.37500
The average call duration for Morocco is (33 + 4 + 59 + 59 + 3 + 7) / 6 = 27.5000 
Global call duration average = (2 * (33 + 4 + 59 + 102 + 330 + 5 + 13 + 3 + 1 + 7)) / 20 = 55.70000
Since Peru is the only country where average call duration is greater than the global average, it's the only recommended country.

# Write your MySQL query statement below

#average call duration of the calls in this country is strictly greater than the global average call duration

# caller 跟 callee 合併 id
with t as (
    select * from Calls 
    union all
    select callee_id, caller_id, duration from Calls)

select name as country # result: country 就只要select 那一行就好
from(
    select c.name, duration
    from Person p, Country c, t
    where left(phone_number, 3) = country_code AND
    p.id = t.caller_id) t2  #3 table合併 用where 條件1 AND 條件2 連接
    group by name 
    having avg(duration) > # country
            (select avg(duration) #global
            from calls )

# 記得having avg 不能直接 > having
 #  要大於table 裡的 avg
