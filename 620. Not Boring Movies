# Write your MySQL query statement below

Write an SQL query to report the movies with an odd-numbered ID and a description that is not "boring".

Return the result table ordered by rating in descending order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Cinema table:
+----+------------+-------------+--------+
| id | movie      | description | rating |
+----+------------+-------------+--------+
| 1  | War        | great 3D    | 8.9    |
| 2  | Science    | fiction     | 8.5    |
| 3  | irish      | boring      | 6.2    |
| 4  | Ice song   | Fantacy     | 8.6    |
| 5  | House card | Interesting | 9.1    |
+----+------------+-------------+--------+
Output: 
+----+------------+-------------+--------+
| id | movie      | description | rating |
+----+------------+-------------+--------+
| 5  | House card | Interesting | 9.1    |
| 1  | War        | great 3D    | 8.9    |
+----+------------+-------------+--------+
Explanation: 
We have three movies with odd-numbered IDs: 1, 3, and 5. The movie with ID = 3 is boring so we do not include it in the answer.

#定奇數
1. WHERE mod(id.2) = 1 
2. WHERE id%2 <> 0

SELECT *
FROM Cinema
#WHERE mod(id.2) = 1 
WHERE id%2 <> 0
#定奇數
AND description != 'boring'
ORDER BY rating DESC
