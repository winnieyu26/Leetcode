Write an SQL query to find the account_id of the accounts that should be banned from Leetflex. An account should be banned if it was logged in at some moment from two different IP addresses.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example:

 

LogInfo table:
+------------+------------+---------------------+---------------------+
| account_id | ip_address | login               | logout              |
+------------+------------+---------------------+---------------------+
| 1          | 1          | 2021-02-01 09:00:00 | 2021-02-01 09:30:00 |
| 1          | 2          | 2021-02-01 08:00:00 | 2021-02-01 11:30:00 |
| 2          | 6          | 2021-02-01 20:30:00 | 2021-02-01 22:00:00 |
| 2          | 7          | 2021-02-02 20:30:00 | 2021-02-02 22:00:00 |
| 3          | 9          | 2021-02-01 16:00:00 | 2021-02-01 16:59:59 |
| 3          | 13         | 2021-02-01 17:00:00 | 2021-02-01 17:59:59 |
| 4          | 10         | 2021-02-01 16:00:00 | 2021-02-01 17:00:00 |
| 4          | 11         | 2021-02-01 17:00:00 | 2021-02-01 17:59:59 |
+------------+------------+---------------------+---------------------+

Result table:
+------------+
| account_id |
+------------+
| 1          |
| 4          |
+------------+
Account ID 1 --> The account was active from "2021-02-01 09:00:00" to "2021-02-01 09:30:00" with two different IP addresses (1 and 2). It should be banned.
Account ID 2 --> The account was active from two different addresses (6, 7) but in two different times.
Account ID 3 --> The account was active from two different addresses (9, 13) on the same day but they do not intersect at any moment.
Account ID 4 --> The account was active from "2021-02-01 17:00:00" to "2021-02-01 17:00:00" with two different IP addresses (10 and 11). It should be banned.

# Write your MySQL query statement below

# logged in at some moment from two different IP addresses.
select DISTINCT L1.account_id # 結果是要 1.同一個id 
FROM LogInfo L1, LogInfo L2 
WHERE L1.account_id= L2.account_id # 1.同一個id
AND  L1.ip_address != L2.ip_address  # 2.不同ＩＰ
AND L2.login between L1.login AND L1.logout # 第二次登入在Ｌ1 使用期間

# OR 

SELECT DISTINCT L1.account_id
FROM LogInfo L1
INNER JOIN LogInfo L2 
ON L1.account_id = L2.account_id AND
L1.ip_address != L2.ip_address AND
L2.login BETWEEN L1.login AND L1.logout
