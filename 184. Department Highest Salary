+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| 1  | Joe   | 70000  | 1            |

| 3  | Henry | 80000  | 2            |
| 4  | Sam   | 60000  | 2            |
| 5  | Max   | 90000  | 1            |

| IT         | Max      | 90000  |
| IT         | Jim      | 90000  |

# Write your MySQL query statement below

# 法１ dense_rank() 或是 rank

-- find employees who have the highest salary in each of the departments. 
select Department, Employee, Salary
from 
(select 
    D.Name as Department, E.Name as Employee, E.Salary as Salary, 
    dense_rank() over(partition by D.Name order by E.Salary desc) as rnk -- 多創個column 排序 1,2,3
    -- dense_rank 或是 rank 都可以, 記得後面要where rnk = 1
    -- in each of the departments 用partition by department (D.Name)
    -- order by 大到小 desc
from Employee E join Department D on E.DepartmentId = D.Id  --> 是 Employee 的 department id 和 Department id 連 （都是department id)
) as tmp
where rnk = 1  --選那個 多創個col 排序1的


# 法２ join
SELECT
    Department.name AS Department,
    Employee.name AS Employee,
    Salary
FROM
    Employee e
        JOIN Department d ON e.DepartmentId = d.Id
WHERE
    (e.DepartmentId , Salary) IN  --用 IN 查dep.和Salary的关系。
        (SELECT DepartmentId, MAX(Salary)
            FROM Employee
            GROUP BY DepartmentId);



| DepartmentId | MAX(Salary) |
|--------------|-------------|
| 1            | 90000       |
| 2            | 80000       |

-- in 之後
| Department | Employee | Salary |
|------------|----------|--------|
| Sales      | Henry    | 80000  |
| IT         | Max      | 90000  |
