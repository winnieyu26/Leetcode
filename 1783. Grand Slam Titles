# Write your MySQL query statement below

#  won by each player. Do not include the players who did not win any tournament.

1. 把名字改成id  因為 Championship 表中的 1, 2 是 PLAYER ID 1,2 
2. UNION ALL 分別取出 不同的ＩＤ (所以可以用它來分組 知道各個ＩＤ 拿多少獎牌）
3. ＩＮＮＥＲ ＪＯＩＮ 或是 ＬＥＦＴ ＪＯＩＮ都可以 --> 用Player_id 來 JOIN


SELECT p.player_id, player_name, COUNT(t.player_id) as grand_slams_count
FROM 
(SELECT Wimbledon as player_id from Championships
UNION ALL
SELECT Fr_open as player_id from Championships
UNION ALL
SELECT US_open as player_id from Championships
UNION ALL
SELECT Au_open as player_id from Championships) t 
INNER JOIN Players p ON t.player_id = p.player_id 
GROUP BY player_id 
#Having COUNT(t.player_id)>0  # 可有可無 INNER JOIN 沒有NULL 可以不用數
