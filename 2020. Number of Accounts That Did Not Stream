| 5          | 2020-09-11 | 2021-01-17 |
+------------+------------+------------+
Streams table:
+------------+------------+-------------+
| session_id | account_id | stream_date |
+------------+------------+-------------+
| 14         | 9          | 2020-05-16  |
| 16         | 3          | 2021-10-27  |

# Write your MySQL query statement below

# 2021有 sub 但沒有stream

select count(s1.account_id) AS accounts_count
from Subscriptions s1
Left join Streams s2
ON s1.account_id = s2.account_id
Where end_date between '2021-01-01' AND '2021-12-31'
AND stream_date NOT Between '2021-01-01' AND '2021-12-31'

# OR 
SELECT COUNT(sub.account_id) accounts_count
FROM Subscriptions sub, Streams s 
WHERE sub.account_id = s.account_id 
AND YEAR(sub.end_date) = 2021
AND YEAR(s.stream_date) <> 2021
