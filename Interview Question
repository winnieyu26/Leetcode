Write a query: 
1. Return emp record with highest salary
2. Return the highest salary in emp table
3. Return 2nd highest salary in emp table
4. Select range of emp based on ID
5. Return an employee with the highest salary and the emp's department name 
6. Return highest salary, emp_name, department_name for each department 


ANS:
1. select * from emp
   where salary = (select max(salary) from emp) ------ 當 salary = max salary

2. select Max(salary) from emp

3. select Max(salary) from emp  ----select max salary
   where salary NOT IN (select Max(salary) from emp  ------NOT IN = not equal 選不是最高的
   
4. select * from emp
   where emp_id betwenn 2003 and 2008 ------ range 用 between A and B
   
5. select first_name, last_name, salary, department_name ------ 1) department_name 不是在 emp table, 但emp裡有"department_id"
   from Employee e INNER JOIN Department                 ----- 2) department_name 在 department table, 但emp裡有"department_id"
  
   3) 把兩個table 取名 e, d ----- 記得前面select 也要加個 e.first_name (Table名.column)
   select e.first_name, e.last_name, e.salary, d.department_name
   from Emp e INNER JOIN Department d ON (e.department_id = d.department_id)   ------- 4) “JOIN” new table “ON” （___ = ___） 兩個table 共同點
   ---- 到這邊可以先跑看長怎樣 ---- 5) 我們得到所有的salary 但我們只取 highest salary ---> 最高值想到MAX 
   where salary IN (select Max(salary) from empployee
   
6. seleect e.first_name, e.last_name, e.salary, d.department_name
   from emp e INNER JOIN Department d ON e.department_id = d.department_id)
   where salary IN (select Max(salary) from employee group by department_id)  ---- for each department: 用 group by
